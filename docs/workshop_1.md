## How does computer work?

### Hardware 
Hardware is the physical components of a computer. It includes:
- CPU (Central Processing Unit)
- RAM (Random Access Memory)
- Storage (HDD, SSD)
- Input/Output devices (Keyboard, Mouse, Monitor, Printer)
- Motherboard
- Power Supply
- Cooling system
- Case
- [More about computer hardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_hardware)

### Software
Software is a collection of instructions that tell the computer how to work. It includes:
- Operating System (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Applications (Word, Excel, Chrome, etc.)
- Drivers
- [More about computer software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software)

### How does computer work?
The computer works by executing a series of instructions. It includes:
1. The CPU fetches the instruction from the memory.
2. The CPU decodes the instruction.
3. The CPU executes the instruction.
4. Repeat the process until the program is finished.
5. The CPU sends the result to the output device.
6. The CPU waits for the next instruction.

### What is instruction?
An instruction is a command that tells the computer what to do. It includes:
- Arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
- Logical operations (AND, OR, NOT)
- Data transfer (move data from one place to another)
- Control flow (if, else, while, for)
- [More about computer instruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set_architecture)

### What does decoding mean?
Decoding is the process of translating the instruction into a series of signals that the CPU can understand. It includes:
- Reading the instruction from the memory.
- Identifying the operation to be performed.
- Fetching the data from the memory.
- Performing the operation.
- Storing the result back to the memory.
- [More about computer decoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_cycle)

### What is memory?
Memory is a storage device that stores data and instructions. It includes:
- RAM (Random Access Memory)
- ROM (Read-Only Memory)
- Cache

## What is programming?
Programming is the process of creating a set of instructions that tell the computer how to perform a task. It includes:
- Writing code
- Testing code
- Debugging code
- [More about programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming)

### Why do we need programming?
- To automate repetitive tasks
- To solve complex problems
- To create software applications
- To build websites
- To develop games
- etc.

### What is code?
Code is a set of instructions written in a programming language. It includes:
- Variables
- Data types
- Operators
- Control structures
- Functions
- Classes
- etc.

### What is programming language?
A programming language is a formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to produce various kinds of output. It includes:
- Python
- C/C++
- C#
- Rust
- Java
- JavaScript
- etc.

### What is Python?
Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive, and object-oriented scripting language. It includes:
- Easy to learn
- Easy to read
- Easy to maintain
- Portable
- Extensible

### Basic Python syntax
Python syntax is the set of rules that defines how a Python program will be written and interpreted.
Syntax is like the grammar of a programming language.

Following code will print "Hello, World!" to the console.
```python
# This is a comment
print("Hello, World!")
```

### What is console?
Console is a text-based interface that allows users to interact with the computer. It includes:
- Command Prompt (Windows)
- Terminal (macOS, Linux)
- Python Shell (IDLE)
- [More about console](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_terminal)

### CLI vs GUI
CLI (Command Line Interface) is a text-based interface that allows users to interact with the computer using commands.

GUI (Graphical User Interface) is a visual interface that allows users to interact with the computer using graphical elements.
